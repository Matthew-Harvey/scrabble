# scrabble game:

Utilizes threads to allow multiple loops to run simultanously, therefore certain editiors and environments might not be able to run. I run it in VS code.

The game is where you are given a string and have to get all the possible words woth a combination of the given characters, this is within a set time limit so the aim is to rush to find the most words in the time.

After completion of time, the user is given a menu to analyse averages, and other varieties of statistics.
